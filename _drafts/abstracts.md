All things in life should have an abstract, and that≈õ why I'm writing them at my blog.

It's difficult to tell apart the interesting stuff from the deep ocean of blabber, cats, heated opinions and porn that is the internet

I propose something simple: instead of having to trust a title, a headline specially crafted to attract attention, why not publishing abstracts?

A simple, 2-5 sentences paragraph that summarizes the "core" of the text. It should not replace the text, of course, it should only introduce the subject and the main opinions stated about it.

Think about that: how many bad articles have you started reading just to discover in media res that, well, you really did not care about that.

Granted that we should not only read what interests us, and I have had many grateful surprises with texts which I thought were about something I knew, but weren't, and I ended up learning something useful, getting to know another point of view, from another perspective, and these are the moments in which you are most at risk of actually learning something, of becoming a "better person", whatever that may mean to you.

My abstracts, however, do not tamper that. Do not impede discovering new texts. If the abstract is carefully written, it can act in just the opposite way: it can attract people to your text that wouldn't be otherwise.

The easier it is for people to get to know what you are talking about, the better for you. If you have something interesting to say.

People that rely only on *bam!* impactant titles and no content do not deserve our precious time, our limited amount of precious, succulent, juicy reading time.

And if abstracts help just by keeping these people away and unread, they would be already justified, in a world full of porn, heated opinions, blabber and cats.
