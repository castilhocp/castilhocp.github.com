	<p>Hey there, stranger! Yep, you, staring at your computer screen without a clue about what the heck you will read in the next 2 minutes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to talk with you. About things that have never been mentioned before. About simple things, complex stuff, dark matters, muons, protons and behavioral economics.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have the faintest idea about any of this, but I like to talk, and I reckon that you like to read. Or else, why would you be here?</p>

<p>I am a engineer. Electronical one. The kind of engineer that likes tiny blimping LEDs, the mechanical sound of those little black buzzers and soldering. My God, how I love soldering. There&#8217;s nothing like the sweet smell of lead in the morning.</p>

<p>Besides that, now I am a graduate student in business administration. Yeah, like those MBAs, but in Brazil they are a tad different. I will be a M.Sc. after I graduate, which makes, in my humble opinion, no difference at all.</p>

<p>Why that, if, for the love of God, I love to solder? Well, it also happens that I love marketing. In a broad sense. I love to make things and love that other people love the things I make. That&#8217;s marketing. At least <em>true</em> marketing, as I like to think about it. Learning how to make things that people are going to love. And knowing how to make it possible for them to buy it, have it, read it, consume it, eat it, use it. You see, marketing is certainly not about <em>making</em> people do things that makes you money, it&#8217;s not about persuading people to do and buy things they don&#8217;t want. Sure, there are bad people out there (dumb people) that believe in it. Not me. I am marketing persuasion agnostic.</p>

<p>Engineer and marketer, I am also a programmer. That&#8217;s almost like being an engineer. In fact I learned how to program at college. But I like how the adjective &#8216;programmer&#8217; sound, so I use it side by side with engineer.</p>
